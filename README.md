# Accurate Biot-Savart routines with Correct Asymptotic Behaviour
<img src="abscab_logo.png" alt="ABSCAB logo" width="200" align="right"/>

This library can be used to compute the magnetic field and the magnetic vector potential
of filamentary current carriers in the form of a circular loop and straight segments.
Arbitrary geometries of conductors can be approximated by a polygon along its contour
and the connecting segments between the polygon vertices are modeled by straight segments.
Finite-width conductors can be approximated by arranging multiple filaments
throughout the cross section of the current carrier.
